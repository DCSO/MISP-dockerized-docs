# Release Policy

What to expect when upgrading MISP-dockerized.

We adhere to [semantic versioning](http://semver.org).


## Patch/Bugfix Releases (1.9.x)

Patch and bugfixe releases are released as soon as possible.

Bugfix releases are made regularly to make sure MISP-dockerized stays stable, secure, and bug-free.
The higher the third digit, the more tested and stable the release is.

Bugfix releases focus on fixing bugs and not making major changes.


## Minor/Feature Releases (1.9.x)

Minor and feature releases are released quarterly.

Whenever we introduce new features, we bump the middle version number.
These releases are not as mature as bugfix releases, but they are considered stable and useable.

We make every effort to be backward-compatible in these releases.


## Major (But Not Breaking) Releases (1.x.0)

It is inevitable that continuously improving security and enterprise readiness. 
Therefore, for every change that does not allow direct updating, there will be a major release.
These releases are opportunities for the core team to make strategic changes to the underlying platform.

## Major/Breaking Releases (x.0.0)
Ideally, these are released infrequently.

It is inevitable that continuously improving security and enterprise readiness will be necessary. 
Therefore, for every change that does not allow direct updating, there will be a major release.
These releases are opportunities for the core team to make strategic changes to the underlying platform.
