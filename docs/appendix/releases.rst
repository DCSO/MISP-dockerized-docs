Release Policy
##############

What to expect when upgrading MISP-dockerized.

We adhere to `semantic versioning`_.

.. _semantic versioning: http://semver.org


Patch/Bugfix Releases (1.9.x)
-----------------------------
As soon as possible.

Bugfix releases are made regularly to make sure MISP-dockerized stays stable, secure, and bug-free.
The higher the third digit, the more tested and stable the release is.

Since bugfix release focus on fixing bugs and not making major changes.


Minor/Feature Releases (1.9.x)
------------------------------
Quarterly.

Whenever we introduce new features, we'll bump the middle version number.
These releases aren't as mature as bugfix release, but are considered stable and useable.

We make every effort to be backward compatible in these releases.


Major BUT NOT BREAKING Releases (1.x.0)
---------------------------------------


It is inevitable that this will have to continuously improve security and enterprise readiness. 
Therefore, for every change that does not allow direct updating, a major release will be released. 
These releases are opportunities for the core team to make strategic changes to the underlying platform.


Major/Breaking Releases (x.0.0)
-------------------------------
Hopefully not that often.

It is inevitable that this will have to continuously improve security and enterprise readiness. 
Therefore, for every change that does not allow direct updating, a major release will be released. 
These releases are opportunities for the core team to make strategic changes to the underlying platform.
